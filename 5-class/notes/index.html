## CSBC 1000 - Fundamentals of Backend and Blockchain Development

### Class 5: The product development process 

*Dhruvin Parikh*

</script></section>


<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Class Plan
* 

</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Purpose
* Developers are a core part of a team
* Need a fundamental understanding of how SDLC works
* Often thrown onto teams without an explanation of how
things work
* Will give you a leg up and allow you to join Agile teams
with an understanding of process
* Allow you to focus on your output

</script></section>


<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## What does a successful software project look like? (10 mins)

</script></section>


<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## What is Agile?
* Main thing: ability to create and respond to change
* Consists of many methodologies
 * Scrum
 * Kanban
 * Extreme Programming (XP)

</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Agile Vs Waterfall

<img src="./agile-waterfall.png">

* Agile : features delivery linearly over time
* Waterfall : feature delivery  is non-linear over time

</script></section>


<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## 12 principles

* Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early
and continuous delivery of valuable software.
* Welcome changing requirements, even late in development.*
* Deliver working software frequently.
* Business people and developers must work together.
* Build projects around motivated individuals.
* Working software is the primary measure of progress.

</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

  ## 12 principles
  
  * Promote sustainable development; can work at the pace
  indefinitely.
  * Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design
  enhances agility.
  * Simplicity–the art of maximizing the amount of work not done–is
  essential.
  * The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from
  self-organizing teams.
  * At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more
  effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

  ## Iterative & Incremental
  1. Verify Idea
  2. Improve it
  3. Add value
  4. Ready it
  5. Done

</script></section>


<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

  ## Scrum
  * A framework for developing software based on
  empiricism
  * Not focusing on algorithmic and hyperplanned
  development
  * Focused on people and self-organization

</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

  ## Scrum framework
  
  <img src="./scrum-framework.png"> 

</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

  ## Scrum Values
  * commitment
  * courage
  * focus
  * openness
  * respect

</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

  ## Scrum Team Roles
  * Product Owner 
  * Scrum Master
  * Development Team

</script></section>


<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

  ## Product Owner
  * Responsible for maximizing the value of the product resulting from work of the Development Team
  * Single person accountable for the product
  * Writing User Stories
  * Reordering the Product Backlog (prioritizing)
  * Ensures Development Team understands backlog items

</script></section>


<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

  ## Scrum Master
  * Responsible for promoting and supporting Scrum
  * Serves the Product Owner, Development Team, and entire organization
  * Helps PO manage backlog, write clear user stories, ensures product goals are well understood
  * Helps Dev Team be self-organized and accountable, removes impediments (unblocks), pushes back against PO when the impossible is requested
  * Helps entire org by coaching Scrum, planning and facilitating Scrum events and ceremonies, working with other Scrum Masters

</script></section>


<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

  ## Development Team
  * Responsible creating a potentially releasable amount of work at the end of each Sprint, and deciding on what amount of work is possible
  * Nobody tells them how to do their work
  * Can include developers, UI/UX, testers, or anybody else
  who is responsible hands-on for building a part of the
  product
  * Typically 3-9 people

</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

  ## Scrum Events
  * The Sprint
  * Sprint Planning
  * Daily Scrum
  * Sprint Review
  * Sprint Retrospective

</script></section>


<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

  ## Sprint Planning
  * Meeting to discuss the work to be performed
  * Attendees: Scrum Master, Dev Team, Product Owner
  * Time boxed to four hours per two-week sprint (if sprints are a week long, then two hours planning)
  * Answers two questions:
   * What can be delivered in the Increment resulting from the upcoming Sprint?
   * How will the work needed to deliver the increment be achieved?

</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

  ## Sprint Planning
  * What can be done this Sprint?
   * Decided based on Product Backlog, the latest product
  Increment, projected capacity of the Development
  Team during the Sprint, and past performance of the
  Development Team
   * Output: Sprint Backlog, with User Stories estimated
  (pointed), acceptance criteria defined, and Sprint Goal
  set

</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

  ## Sprint Planning
  * How will the chosen work get done?
   * Dev Team decides what order things should be done
   * Breaks down User Stories into tasks (ie. frontend,
  backend, etc.)
   * PO is available to clarify any questions or priorities, or
  to negotiate amount of work that's being done

</script></section>


<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

  ## The Sprint
  * A time-box of one month or less during which a "Done",
  useable, and potentially releasable product increment is
  created
  * Typically 2 weeks (I recommend 1 week for new teams, 2
  weeks for experienced teams)
  * Contains all of the events: Sprint Planning, Daily Scrums,
  the development work, the Sprint Review, and the Sprint
  Retrospective
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

  ## The Sprint
  * No changes are made that would endanger the Sprint Goal
   * PO can't come in and say they want some random new flashy idea
   * Time should be pre-allocated for "firefighting" and unexpected issues
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

  ## The Sprint
  * Quality goals do not decrease
   * If running out of time, don't skip unit tests just to get a story done
   * If this happens, you'll pay for it next sprint when things break
  * Scope may be clarified and re-negotiated between the Product Owner and Development Team as more is learned
   * It's okay to ask questions and redefine acceptance criteria if new
  things are learned
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

  ## Daily Scrum
  * Quick (under 15-minute meeting) to plan out the next 24
  hours
  * Attendees: Scrum Master, Dev Team
  * Scrum Master ensures the meeting happens, but Dev
  Team members facilitate
  * Designed to optimize work by ensuring team members
  can do their work, have what they need, and are not
  blocked by anything (missing information, having trouble
  with an implementation)

</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

  ## Daily Scrum
  * Bad format: take turns in a circle and answer What did I do yesterday? What will I do today? Am I blocked?
  * Good format: for each story, discuss what was worked on
  yesterday, what will be worked on today, and if there are
  blockers for that particular story
  * Focus on user stories, not on individual developers

</script></section>


<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

  ## Sprint Review
  * Informal meeting that happens at end of Sprint to
  examine the product progress (increment)
  * Discuss what can be done next, changes that are
  required, anything missed
  * Attendees: Scrum Master, Dev Team, Product Owner, and
  any stakeholders invited by PO
  * Max four hours per two-week sprint

</script></section>


<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

  ## Sprint Review
  * Product Owner explains what Product Backlog items have been "Done"
  and what has not been "Done";
  * Dev Team discusses what went well during the Sprint, what problems it
  ran into, and how those problems were solved
  * Dev Team demonstrates the work that it has "Done" and answers
  questions

</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

  ## Sprint Review
  * Product Owner discusses the Product Backlog as it stands, projects
  delivery dates
  * Review of the timeline, budget, potential capabilities, and marketplace
  for the next anticipated releases of functionality or capability of the
  product

</script></section>


<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

  ## Sprint Retrospective
  * Internal meeting to look back at itself and create an
  improvement plan
  * Attendees: Scrum Master, Dev Team
  * Max 3 hours per two-week sprint

</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

  ## Sprint Retrospective
  * Inspect how the last Sprint went with regards to people,
  relationships, process, and tools
  * Identify and order the major items that went well and
  potential improvements
  * Create a plan for implementing improvements to the way
  the Scrum Team does its work

</script></section>


<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

  ## User Stories
  * Short and simple description of the feature or
  requirements of the project
  * Answers who, what, why

</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

  * **AS A** [who]
  * **I WANT** [what]
  * **SO THAT** [why]

</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

  * **AS A** *customer*
  * **I WANT** *to log into the website*
  * **SO THAT** *I can check my balance*

</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

  ## User Stories (INVEST)
   * **Independent** - Reduced dependencies so easier to plan
   * **Negotiable** - Collaborative effort for detailing
   * **Valuable** - Provides value to the customer and business
   * **Estimable** - Small enough and split well for team to estimate
   * **Small Enough** - Can be completed in less than a week by the team
   * **Testable** - Good acceptance criteria

</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

  ## User Stories vs Tasks
  * **User Story**: end-to-end functionality visible to users
  * **Tasks**: things that need to be done by developers, part of
  user stories
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

  ## Relative estimation
  * Why do we do it?
   * Estimate scope/schedule for a project
   * Help PO prioritize stories
   * Estimate how much will fit in a sprint
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

  ## Definition of Done
  * 
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

  * **Product** : A small college campus
  * Feature
   * Classroom 1 • Study space
